## How it works?
User enters data(school, teachers, classes, teachers, lessons). 
The data is transferred to the generator(ScheGen/schegen/genApp/generator.py) in json format.
Then the algorithm generates 30 lesson plans and choose the best one based on scores.
Points are allocated based on the empty slots between lessons. 
The timetable with the fewest points is selected.
The more precise operation of the generator is described in the file generator.py(ScheGen/schegen/genApp/generator.py).
